            <h2 class="mt-4">Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Brian Hooper. I am a husband, father, and technologist who lives, works, and plays in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
            <p>I enjoy working with startups and enterprises around the globe supporting the delivery of their continuous improvement efforts through infrastructure as code, 
                advanced platform and automation capabilities. DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that helps teams deliver end-to-end 
                applications and infrastructure solutions safely with velocity.</p>

                home office tinkering around with my own projects. Outside of technology I enjoy the outdoors,
                cooking, traveling, and coaching youth soccer.</p>

                    <li>Infrastructure as Code</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">I believe that businesses and teams of any size should experience the benefits
                of a well-equipped platform. Overall, I am most happy when I am working on projects that deliver
                significant value and create real momentum.
