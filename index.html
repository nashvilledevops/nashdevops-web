            <h3>What is DevOps?</h3>
            <p>DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev) and software & infrastructure operations (Ops). 
                The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction. This culture 
                focuses on agility and increasing efficiency through feedback loops, to strive for continuous improvement and enhance the end-user experience. DevOps 
                aims to achieve shorter development cycles more rapidly, in close alignment with business objectives.

                <h3>What is our Mission?</h3>
                <p>NashDevOps is focused on creating a community of collaboration for cross-functional Technology Professionals, to learn from each other, by way of 
                    sharing their experiences and curiosities. This is intended for those looking for better IT solutions and better ways to get there by sharing 
                    their lessons learned and knowledge. Those who attend should be willing to participate or observe conversations about a wide-range of topics.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="row my-4">
            <h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
            <p>To stimulate and grow the tech scene, in Nashville. Also, to understand & identify common patterns of problems to solve for; that businesses, 
            organizations, cultures, people, process, and tool-sets, are challenged with. We encourage sharing methodologies & practices, that are being adopted 
            and proven to be successful. Especially from the High-Tech companies based out of Silicon Valley, that have shown "the way" over the last 2 - 3 decades.</p>
            <p>We are finding that digital businesses or software-based companies, can be very disruptive, very quickly. In order for traditional or legacy companies 
                to survive and have a sustainable business in the Digital-Era then, they must focus on delivering high quality software faster, than they are today...In 
                order to combat the disruption and maintain their market share. Or, they can be a disrupter themselves, regardless of their industry vertical.</p>

        <div class="row my-4">
